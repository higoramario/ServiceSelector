FTTServiceSelector (FSS)
===============

A mechanism to select services for compositions. FTTServiceSelector generates 
all possible combinations between services to compositions to different 
Fault-Tolerance Techniques. 
The selection criteria is based on QoS constraint values and uses.


Instructions:

To run FSS, put the yaml files in the folder "inputs". 
The file with the available services must contain the roles and services with their 
respective response time and reliability values.
The another file must contain the expected values for response time and reliability of the composition.
Choose the name of these files in CompositionManager class (line 67). 
Choose the FTT strategy in CompositionManager class (lines 69-72).

FSS generates two files:
- In the folder "solutions" FSS generates the solution file with all compositions that keep the QoS constraint values.
- In the folder "results" FSS generates a summary of the execution, including the time spent, number of combinations and solutions.

We kept the input files and the result files used in experiments as examples to use FSS and to generate new yaml files. 
We just kept 4 solution files due to the size of these files. Using FSS for roles and/or replicas with large sizes could generate large files.
